# Thien's Digital Garden

Welcome to my second brain. This website is built to collect all of my notes, studies mostly about programming, building products, and useful snippets.

I believe that learning and practicing is the key of every success, especially in the IT industry which is moving rapidly. However, there is a problem to me (and maybe you too) that **I cannot remember and organize my knowledge**.

To solve the problem, I attempt to write down everything I've learned and then turn back to fine-tuning them.

## Organizing notes

I group all of my notes by category as you can see in the left sidebar.
