title: CSS line-height

The `line-height` property defines the amount of space above and below inline elements. That is, elements that are set to `display: inline` or `display: inline-block`. This property is most often used to set the [leading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading) for lines of text.

With unitless line heights the child elements can compute their line heights based on their computed font size.
